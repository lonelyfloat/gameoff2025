# THEME: WAVES
* Obvious: Sound waves
    * I should roll with this bc its a strength of mine
* Definitely some sort of gameified sound design game
    - Really like the idea of approaching some kind of end goal with the sound as a 'level'

## IDEA 1:
* Game where you use some quirky controls to make weird sci-fi sound effects (krell patch)
* Maybe you get rated on certain aspects of the 'patch' -- so it's a puzzle game
    - Maybe you're making the honk sounds for alien spaceships??
* Pros:
    - Silly
    - Whimsical
* Cons:
    - How do I make this fun for people who aren't sound designers, what do I want the mechanical fun for this to be
* 10 small mazes inspo?

## IDEA 2:
* WarioWare-inspired game where each 'level' is a challenger who wants a specific type of sound
* You slowly reach it by doing a bunch of little minigames
    * e.g. filter minigame, overdrive minigame, etc.
- Theming ideas for this:
    * You're a sound designer for a variety of idiosyncratic electronic pop stars
        - you have to decode what they mean by things (maybe use colors to convey??)
    * Designing sound effects for old cartoons (Foley style???) (running over to old pianos, anvils, etc.)

## FINAL IDEA:
 * You're a sound designer for a variety of idiosyncratic electronic pop stars
    - you have to decode what they mean by things (maybe use colors to convey??)
 * WarioWare-inspired game where each 'level' is a challenger who wants a specific type of sound
 * You slowly reach it by doing a bunch of little minigames
    - e.g. filter minigame, overdrive minigame, etc.
